## [0.7.0] - 2025-08-30

### Added
- **Channel-based Streaming**: New `send_prompt_streaming` method for simplified streaming
  - Uses `tokio::sync::mpsc::UnboundedSender` for easy integration
  - Compatible with all providers (OpenAI and Claude with native streaming, others via fallback)
  - Simpler API compared to BoxStream approach
- **Improved Streaming Support**: Enhanced streaming infrastructure
  - Both OpenAI and Claude now properly implement `send_prompt_streaming`
  - Consistent streaming behavior across providers
  - Better error handling for dropped stream receivers

### Changed
- Updated documentation with channel-based streaming examples
- Improved README with both streaming approaches (BoxStream and Channel)

### Technical Details
- Added `send_prompt_streaming` to `AiClient` trait with default implementation
- OpenAI and Claude clients now bridge their BoxStream implementations to channel-based streaming
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing streaming methods

## [0.6.0] - 2025-08-11

### ðŸš€ Revolutionary Features

#### AI Orchestration System
- **Multi-Model Orchestration**: Coordinate multiple AI models with advanced strategies
